## Constraint Satisfaction Problems (Backtracking Search) Overview

### CSP v.s Traditional Search Problems

- CSP does not care about the _sequence of moves_ to reach goal state

### Feature Vectors

- Represent states as __vectors of feature values__
- Formalization
	- A set of __features/variables__ `V1, ... Vn`
	- __Domain__ for each variable `Dom[Vi]`
	- A set of __constraints__ `C1, ..., Cm`
		- __Scope__: a set of variables it operates over
		- Unary, binary, higher-order constraints
	- __State__: assignment of value for each variable
	- __Partial state__: assignment of value for some variables
	- __Goal state__: a state satisfying all __constraints__

### Constraint Graph

- Nodes: __variables__; arcs: __constraints__

## Solving CSPs

- Search through the space of partial assignments
- Order of assignments does not matter
- If we falsify a constraint, we immediately reject the current partial assignment

### Viewing CSP as Search Problem

- __Initial state__: empty assignment
- __Successor function__: a value assigned to any unassigned variable s.t. no constraints return false
- __Goal test__: complete assignment

### Backtracking Search Algorithm

- Similar to DFS

```
BT(Level):
	If all variables assigned:
		PRINT Value of each Variable
		RETURN

	V := PickUnassignedVariable()
	Assigned[V] := TRUE
	for d := each member of Domain(V):
		Value[V] := d
    	ConstraintsOK = TRUE
      	for each constraint C such that
            a) V is a variable of C and
			b) all other variables of C are assigned: 
			If C is not satisfied by the set of current assignments:
				ConstraintsOK = FALSE
				break
      	If ConstraintsOk == TRUE:
			BT(Level+1)
	Assigned[V] := FALSE //UNDO as we have tried all of V’s values return
```

### Constraint Propagation

- Look ahead

#### Forward Checking

- When instantiating a variable, check all constrants with __only one ininstantiated variable__ remaining
- Prune values of that variable that violate the constraint
- Algorithm

	```
	FCCheck(C,x):
		// C is a constraint with all its variables already assigned, except for variable x

		for d := each member of CurDom[x]:
			If making x = d together with previous assignments
        to variables in scope C falsifies C:
    			remove d from CurDom[x]

 		If CurDom[x] = {}:
 			return DWO (Domain Wipe Out)
 		Else:
 			return ok

 	FC(Level):
		If all variables assigned:
        	PRINT Value of each Variable
        	RETURN

		V := PickAnUnassignedVariable()
   		Assigned[V] := TRUE
   		for d := each member of CurDom(V):
			Value[V] := d
        	DWOoccured:= False
        	for each constraint C over V such that
            	a) C has only one unassigned variable X in its scope:
				If (FCCheck(C,X) == DWO):
	            	DWOoccurred:= True
					break
			If(not DWOoccured)
	        	FC(Level+1)
	        RestoreAllValuesPrunedByFCCheck()
		Assigned[V] := FALSE
		return;
	```


#### Generalizaed Arc Consistency

- `C(V1, ..., Vn)` is GAC with regard to `Vi` iff for every value of `Vi`, there exist values of `V1, ..., Vn` that satisfy C
- If for `Vi = d` is not consistent wrt the constraint, `d` is __arc inconsistent__ and can be removed from domain of `Vi`
- A constraint that is GAC may become non-GAC due to pruning of domain values during search
- Algorithm

	```
	GAC_Enforce():
	// GAC-Queue contains all constraints one of whose variables has had its domain reduced

	while GACQueue not empty:
		C = GACQueue.extract()
		for V := each member of scope(C):
			for d := CurDom[V]:
				Find an assignment A for all other variables in scope(C) such that C(A ∪ V=d) = True
				if A not found:
					CurDom[V] = CurDom[V] – d 
				if CurDom[V] = ∅:
	                empty GACQueue
	                return DWO
				else:
					push all constraints C’ s.t. V ∈ scope(C’) and C’ !∈ GACQueue on to GACQueue
	return TRUE

	GAC(Level):
		If all variables are assigned:
			PRINT Value of each Variable
			RETURN

		V := PickAnUnassignedVariable()
		Assigned[V] := TRUE
		for d := each member of CurDom(V):
			Value[V] := d
			Prune all values of V != d from CurDom[V]
			for each constraint C whose scope contains V:
				Put C on GACQueue
			if(GAC_Enforce() != DWO):
				GAC(Level+1)
			RestoreAllValuesPrunedFromCurDoms()

		Assigned[V] := FALSE
		return;
	```
	- May keep track of __supports__ to avoid having to search through all possible assignments and check satisfication
	- Check if current support still valie, i.e. all values it assigns still lie in the variables' current domains

#### Heuristics

- Ordering of variables
	- __Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)__: returns the variable with the most constrained current domain
	- __Degree Heuristic (DH)__: returns variable imposing the most constraints on remaining unassigned variables
- Ordering of values
	- __Least Constraining Value (LCV)__: the best value is the one ruling out the fewest domain values in other variables that share at least one constraint with var
